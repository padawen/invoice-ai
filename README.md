## üèóÔ∏è Environment Setup (Don't Skip This!)

### Prerequisites (Install These or Cry Later)

1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **npm/yarn** - Should come with Node.js
3. **Git** - You know what this is
4. **A sense of humor** - Essential for debugging

### üö¶ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

#### 1. Clone This Magnificent Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/invoice-ai.git
cd invoice-ai
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies (The Fun Part)
```bash
npm install
# or if you're a yarn person
yarn install
```

This will also automatically install Playwright browsers (thanks to our postinstall script).

#### 3. Environment Variables Setup üîë

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add these secrets:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional: Local LLM endpoint (if you're running your own)
LOCAL_LLM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000

# Optional: Custom API endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Where to get these magical keys:**

**Supabase Setup:**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project (it's free!)
3. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API
4. Copy your Project URL and anon key
5. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Service Role Keys
6. Copy the service role key (keep this secret!)

**OpenAI Setup:**
1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account and get API credits
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new secret key
5. Add some credits to your account (you'll need them)

#### 4. Database Setup (Supabase Magic) üóÉÔ∏è

You'll need to create these tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Processed invoices table
CREATE TABLE processed_items (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  fields JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE processed_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own projects" ON projects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own projects" ON projects
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Similar policies for processed_items...
```

#### 5. Run the Development Server üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and witness the magic!

### üöÄ Production Deployment

#### Render Environment Configuration

**Build-time Environment Variables** (required during build):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key (client-side)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Your production site URL (client-side)

**Runtime Environment Variables** (injected at runtime by Render):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL for server-side operations
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-only, sensitive)
- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for auth (server-only, sensitive)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection string (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` - Prisma database URL (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` - Non-pooling database URL (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_USER` - Database user (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE` - Database name (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_HOST` - Database host (server-only, sensitive)
- `PRIVACY_API_URL` - Optional privacy API endpoint (server-only)

#### Docker Deployment

Build locally and test:
```bash
docker build -t invoice-ai:standalone .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e POSTGRES_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  invoice-ai:standalone
```

**Security Notes:**
- Server secrets are NOT baked into the Docker image
- All sensitive env vars are injected at runtime by Render
- Client-side env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) are compiled into the build
