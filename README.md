# 🤖 Invoice AI: The Accountant's Worst Nightmare

> *"Finally, an AI that understands my pain" - Every freelancer ever*

## 🎭 What Fresh Hell Is This?

Welcome to Invoice AI, the only app that makes processing invoices less painful than stepping on a LEGO barefoot. This AI-powered financial torture device extracts data from your invoices faster than you can say "tax deduction," organizes them by project (because chaos is not a filing system), and provides analytics so beautiful you'll almost forget you're broke.

## 🚀 Installation: A Journey of Self-Discovery

### Step 1: Accept Your Fate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/padawen/invoice-ai.git
cd invoice-ai
```
*Congratulations, you've committed to yet another side project you'll abandon in 3 months.*

### Step 2: Feed the Dependency Monster
```bash
npm install
```
*Watch as your node_modules folder grows larger than your actual codebase.*

### Step 3: Summon the Development Demons
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The app will start on localhost:3000, which is coincidentally the same number of invoices you've been avoiding.*

### Step 4: Question Your Life Choices
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Marvel at the interface that will make you actually want to organize your finances.

## ✨ Features That Will Change Your Life (Probably Not)

- **📁 Project Organization**: Sort invoices by project because "miscellaneous expenses" is not a business strategy
- **📊 Financial Analytics**: Beautiful charts that make your spending look almost intentional
- **🔎 Advanced Filtering**: Find that one receipt from 2019 faster than you can find your will to live
- **💾 Supabase Storage**: Your invoices live in the cloud, safer than your local hard drive

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (AKA Our Weapons of Choice)

- **React 19**: So new it still has that new framework smell
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL with a fancy mustache and authentication superpowers
- **Tailwind CSS**: Making developers feel productive while writing `className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen"`

- **TypeScript**: Because we enjoy arguing with our compiler about types at 2 AM

## 🎯 How It Works (The Magic Explained)

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop your invoice like you're feeding a very expensive digital pet
2. **AI Processing**: Our AI reads your invoice faster than you read terms and conditions
3. **Data Extraction**: Watch as vendor names, amounts, and dates appear like magic (it's actually just regex and tears)
