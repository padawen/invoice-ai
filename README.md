## 🤔 What The Hell Is This?

**Invoice AI** is what happens when developers get tired of manually entering invoice data and think,  
**"Fuck it, let's make the robots do it."** 🤖💥  
This unholy creation uses AI to process invoices so you can spend less time with Excel and more time questioning your life choices. 🧾🧠

> _"This app saved my accounting department so much time that we now have 3 extra hours per day to stare blankly at the wall."_  
> – Some CFO who definitely exists 🧍‍♂️💼🧱

**❌ Problem**: AI isn’t recognizing my invoice  
**✅ Solution**: Did you upload an actual invoice or a pizza menu? 🍕 Be honest.
