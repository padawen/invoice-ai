## 🏗️ Environment Setup (Don't Skip This!)

### Prerequisites (Install These or Cry Later)

1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **npm/yarn** - Should come with Node.js
3. **Git** - You know what this is
4. **A sense of humor** - Essential for debugging

### 🚦 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

#### 1. Clone This Magnificent Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/invoice-ai.git
cd invoice-ai
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies (The Fun Part)
```bash
npm install
# or if you're a yarn person
yarn install
```

This will also automatically install Playwright browsers (thanks to our postinstall script).

#### 3. Environment Variables Setup 🔑

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add these secrets:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional: Local LLM endpoint (if you're running your own)
LOCAL_LLM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000

# Optional: Custom API endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Where to get these magical keys:**

**Supabase Setup:**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project (it's free!)
3. Go to Project Settings → API
4. Copy your Project URL and anon key
5. Go to Project Settings → API → Service Role Keys
6. Copy the service role key (keep this secret!)

**OpenAI Setup:**
1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account and get API credits
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new secret key
5. Add some credits to your account (you'll need them)

#### 4. Database Setup (Supabase Magic) 🗃️

You'll need to create these tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Processed invoices table
CREATE TABLE processed_items (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  fields JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE processed_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own projects" ON projects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own projects" ON projects
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Similar policies for processed_items...
```

#### 5. Run the Development Server 🏃‍♂️

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and witness the magic!

### 🚀 Production Deployment

**Runtime Environment Variables** (injected at runtime by Render):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL for server-side operations
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-only, sensitive)
- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for auth (server-only, sensitive)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (server-only, sensitive)
- `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection string (server-only, sensitive)

#### Docker Deployment

Build locally and test:
```bash
docker build -t invoice-ai:standalone .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  -e POSTGRES_URL=RENDER_ENV_AT_RUNTIME \
  invoice-ai:standalone
```

**Security Notes:**
- Server secrets are NOT baked into the Docker image
- All sensitive env vars are injected at runtime by Render
- Client-side env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) are compiled into the build
